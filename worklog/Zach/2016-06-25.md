# Issue: the filter may be down

So, we need to short it.

This filter is the filter between TP2/3 and TP5/6. Therefore, to short it and remove it from the circuit, one can remove the solder from the legs of the transformer (white "cube") and connect those directly to TP2 and TP3.

Remarks:

* Unsoldering these legs is delicate, but can be done with a soldering iron. Once the solder removed, and while the leg is still hot, _very slightly_ bend the legs of the transformer up, to disconnect those from the board. 
* On these, solder two wires, with a sufficient length to go to TP2 and TP3 respectively
* Insulate the connection with for example heatshrink tubes
* __You don't need to solder the wires on TP2/TP3. There would be enough contact when the wires are bent to ensure a proper connection.__

Once this is done, you should see the same image on TP7/GND than what you see on TP2/3. And TP8/GND should show the enveloppe, feeding it to the ADC on the board.
