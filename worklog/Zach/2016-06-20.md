Over the past week I've been working to get my first image using the Murgen board and arduinos.  
Currently, the Murgen board is powered by and pulsed by an Arduino.  The Servo motor for the transducer is controlled by another arduino.
I gathered the data at TP2 using BitScope, and collected it in MATLAB.  The goal was to get an image from the Murgen board, by whatever means necessary.
I collected the data in MATLAB, but since I'll likely be using Python in the future I reconstructed the image in Python.
Since I did a radial scan with the Servo motor, I had to convert my data from polar to rectangular.
After that, the image was still noise, but I made the image greyscale with a logarithmic scale and I got a very nice image!

What I now know:
- I know how to reconstruct 2D images from the Murgen board.
- Python works for image reconstruction.

Next Steps:
- Image enhancement; what I've got now is good, but there is still work to be done.
- Control Murgen board from Python.
- Gathering data and reconstructing the image at once: preferably in Python but maybe in MATLAB.
- Real-time imaging.
- Gather data from Murgen board via BeagleBone.
- Power, pulse, and gather data from Murgen board via BeagleBone.
