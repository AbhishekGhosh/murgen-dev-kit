Tried to change Murgen board's voltage by rotating P1 potentiometer:
Voltage reading hovers around 54V regardless of how much I rotate P1.
Interesting update: Voltage reading drops to 41V when either the transducer is plugged into the SMA plug or I am reading pulses at TP1.

What I've got so far:
-- Aruino powering Murgen board w 5V and 3.3V
-- Arduino sends two rising edges to cause the Murgen board to pulse.  There is a 300 us gap between pulses to wait for received pulse.
-- 5MHz transducer with focal length of 2 inches (5.08 cm).
-- Oscilloscope reading off of TP1.

Expected outcome:
-- When object placed at focal length, echoes expected ~70 us later.

Actual outcome:
-- Receiving echo!!  It's about ~200mV, reflecting off of plexiglass.

Next steps:
-- Amplification of echo received pulse.
-- Noise reduction.
