I powered the board off the Arduino:

I sent the two 5V pulses from the Arduino:

I connected those two pulses to the Murgen board to get the resulting wave (in yellow; the positive edge of the Arduino pulse is in blue):

Here was my issue though... when I connected to the transducer via SMA and tried to read echoes off of TP1, I only got the one pulse; no echoes:

Having been able to follow the other steps smoothly I'm not sure what went wrong here... I'm using a 50-ohm load transducer.

Looks good. You would be using an arduino that is slower than the trinket pro, hence peaks wider than what I got. You can try to remove one NOP from the arduino to get narrower ones.
That being said, I note that you're using HV of more than 50V. I'd recommend lowering it to ~40V for the tests, indeed the MD0100 gets sensitive at ~90V. A simple flat screwdriver on P1 controls this voltage, try to lower it.

To get the echoes, what is your setup in terms of piezo? What is its frequency / focal zone? Is it immerged? If so, can you make sure that a reflector is put parallel to the transducer face at its focal zone?
It is a bit tricky to get these first echoes, but if you have it set up correctly, echoes should appear at some t (2 * focaldistance/speedofwaves)s (I got mine at ~10cm, that was 2*0.1/1500 = 133us).

Let me know if that works for you,
