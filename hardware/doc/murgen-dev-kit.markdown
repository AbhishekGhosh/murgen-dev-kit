ModuleName: CMP-murgen  



# Module

* CMP-murgen

## Name

murgen-dev-kit

## Description

Getting a home-made open-source ultrasound machine (dev-kit) up and running in your garage / hackerspace / fablab for less than 500$ for the beaglebone black. 

## Narrative

This project is born from a fork from the echOpen project (which aims at providing a low cost, open source ultrasound tool for doctors), with a specific target of providing a technological kit to allow scientists, academics, hackers, makers or OSH fans to hack their way to ultrasound imaging.

# Function:
